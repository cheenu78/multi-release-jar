# multi-release-jar

This uses maven ant plugin to compile and build the jar file. As such I could not find a direct support using maven alone.

## Please Note:

You will need three JDKs (Java 8 or less, Java 9 and Java 10) in order to execute / build and run this project

## To Build and Execute:
```
make_run.bat <JAVA8_HOME> <JAVA9_HOME> <JAVA10_HOME>
```

For example in windows using Eg:
```
make_run.bat C:\Tools\Java\jdk1.8.0_152 C:\Tools\Java\jdk-9.0.4 C:\Tools\Java\jdk-10.0.2
```
